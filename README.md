# SQL - building a database and accessing information from it
In this project I have built a mySQL database and I populated it with a dataset downloaded from Kaggle. Furthermore, with the purpose of practising, I have also implemented multiple queries.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Description/Objective
The purpose of this project is to learn how to build a mySQL database and to practice my skills in the SQL syntax.

* `tables_creation.ipynb` code for creating the Database
* `queries.ipynb`implementing queries

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* mySQL
* Pandas
* csv

## Data
* For this project, I have used the New York AirBnb data from Kaggle, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data).
* As I also want to practice joins, I have split the data in 3 csv files (to be populated in different SQL tables): `airbnb.csv`, `airbnb_host.csv`, and `airbnb_location.csv`

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).

2. Raw data is being kept at `airbnb.csv`, `airbnb_host.csv`, and `airbnb_location.csv`

3. Download mySQL from [this link](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).

3. Database and table creation at `tables_creation.ipynb`.

4. Select data practice at `queries.ipynb`.
